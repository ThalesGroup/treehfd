# Examples


## Installation

Before running the examples, first install `treehfd`, as explained in [README](../README.md).

Then, install `matplotlib` to display the functional components of the example decompositions:
```console
pip install matplotlib
```


## Run Examples

To run the examples, execute the following scripts:
- `example_simulated_data.py` for a case with simulated data, where the regression function combines 
sinusoidal and linear components with interactions.
- `example_housing.py` for the dataset `California Housing`.
