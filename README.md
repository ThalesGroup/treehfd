## Overview üåê

<div align="justify">

**`treehfd`** is a Python module to compute the Hoeffding functional decomposition
of XGBoost models (Chen and Guestrin, 2016) with dependent input variables, using
the TreeHFD algorithm. 
This decomposition breaks down XGBoost models into a sum of functions of one or 
two variables (respectively main effects and interactions), which are intrinsically
explainable, while preserving the accuracy of the initial black-box model.

The TreeHFD algorithm is introduced in the following article: 
**B√©nard, C. (2025). Tree Ensemble Explainability through the Hoeffding Functional Decomposition and
TreeHFD Algorithm. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 38 (NeurIPS 2025), in press.** 

The documentation is available at [Read the Docs](https://treehfd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

XGBoost models for regression and binary classification with numeric input variables
are currently supported, and categorical variables should be one-hot encoded.
**`treehfd`** essentially relies on `xgboost`, `numpy`, `scipy`, and `scikit-learn`.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è
To install **`treehfd`**, run: `pip install treehfd`

<div align="justify">

To install from source, first clone this repository, create
and activate a Python virtual environnement using **Python version >= 3.11**
(`conda` or `uv` can also be used), and run pip at the root directory of the repository:

</div>

```console
python -m venv .treehfd-env
source .treehfd-env/bin/activate
pip install .
```


## Example üîé

<div align="justify">

The output of **`treehfd`** is illustrated with a standard dataset, the California Housing dataset,
where housing prices are predicted from various features, such as the house locations, and
characteristics of the house blocks. The code is provided below and in [examples](examples).

The following figure shows the two main decomposition components for the `longitude` and `Latitude`
variables of a black-box `xgboost` model, fitted with default parameters. 
The **`treehfd`** decomposition is displayed in blue, and compared to the decomposition
induced by `TreeSHAP` with interactions in red, which is directly implemented in `xgboost` package.
In particular, **`treehfd`** clearly identifies the peak of housing prices in the `Longitude` main effect,
corresponding to the San Francisco Bay Area (-122¬∞25'), whereas `TreeSHAP` does not really detect it,
because main effects are entangled with interactions, while they are orthogonal in the Hoeffding decomposition.
 **`treehfd`** also highlights that house prices are lower in northern and eastern California.

```python
# Load packages.
import xgboost as xgb
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing

from treehfd import XGBTreeHFD

if __name__ == "__main__":

    # Fetch California Housing data.
    california_housing = fetch_california_housing()
    X = california_housing.data
    y = california_housing.target

    # Fit XGBoost model.
    xgb_model = xgb.XGBRegressor(eta=0.3, n_estimators=100, max_depth=5)
    xgb_model = xgb_model.fit(X, y)

    # Fit TreeHFD.
    treehfd_model = XGBTreeHFD(xgb_model)
    treehfd_model.fit(X)

    # Compute TreeHFD predictions.
    y_main, y_order2 = treehfd_model.predict(X)
```


## Scientific Background

<div align="justify">

The Hoeffding decomposition was introduced by Hoeffding (1948)
for independent input variables. More recently, Stone (1994) and Hooker (2007)
extended the decomposition to the case of dependent input variables, where uniqueness
of the decomposition is enforced by hierarchical orthogonality constraints. The estimation
from a data sample in the dependent case is a notoriously difficult problem, and 
therefore, the Hoeffding decomposition has long remain an abstract theoretical tool.
TreeHFD computes the Hoeffding decomposition of tree ensembles, based on a 
discretization of the hierarchical orthogonality constraints over the tree partitions.
Such decomposition is proved to be piecewise constant over these partitions,
and the values in each cell for all components are given by solving a least square problem for each tree.
